Although the diary was published in 1946 while Nijinsky was still alive, and the original handwritten volumes were sold at auction in 1979 for more than $100,000, a long-suppressed preface by the psychoanalyst Alfred Adler has now been printed for the first time, in The Archives of General Psychiatry. The preface is the only published first-hand professional opinion of Nijinsky, whose mental illness led to consultations with all the foremost experts of his day, including Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. Its publication was prevented by Nijinsky's wife, Romola, who is said to have found its clinical observations distasteful, objecting in particular to Adler's belief that Nijinsky's schizophrenia was rooted in a pathological sense of inferiority. She replaced the preface with one of her own, which glorified her husband.\n",
